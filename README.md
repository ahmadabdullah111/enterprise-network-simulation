# Computer Networking Project Packet Tracer

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Computer Networking Project** repository. This network simulation was developed using **Cisco Packet Tracer version 8.2.1**, demonstrating an enterprise-scale network setup with diverse components, topologies, and technologies.

The network consists of:

- 8 Routers
- 8 Switches
- 6 PCs
- Multiple Servers (DHCP, FTP, TFTP, Email, SYSLOG)
- ASA 5506 Firewall
- Wireless LAN Controller
- Tunnel links, VTP connections
- Printer and other peripherals

This project simulates a real-world enterprise network focusing on connectivity, security, automation, and scalability.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”¹ Routing & Switching
- **Eight routers** connected to simulate inter-network communication across segments.
- **Eight switches** ensure efficient internal switching.

### ðŸ”¹ Server Environment
- Includes:
  - **DHCP Server** for automatic IP assignment
  - **FTP & TFTP Servers** for file services
  - **Email Server**
  - **SYSLOG Server** for network logging and monitoring

### ðŸ”¹ Client-Side Integration
- Six client PCs configured with specific roles (e.g., client, admin, monitoring).
- All PCs connected via wired or wireless media.

### ðŸ”¹ Security
- **Cisco ASA 5506 Firewall** implemented to control and secure traffic flow.
- **Access policies** defined to restrict unauthorized access.

### ðŸ”¹ Wireless Connectivity
- Integrated **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)** manages wireless clients and APs.

### ðŸ”¹ Peripheral & Special Features
- **Printer** available on the network.
- **Tunnel connections** simulate site-to-site secure links.
- **VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)** used for dynamic VLAN distribution.
- **VLAN Inter-Routing** enables communication between segmented VLANs.
